1. In Jest, what are the differences between describe() and it() globals, and what are good uses for them? Describe() creates a block that groups together related tests. it() creates a specific test case. describe() is useful for grouping together groups of it() statements that are related while it() is good for testing specific aspects of the code.

2. What is the point of Test Driven Development? What do you think about this approach? The point of TDD is to write tests and build software that passes those tests. In creating the tests it forces the developer to determine exactly how the feature should function and what the requirements should be. I think that it is a useful practice for larger code bases with many moving parts, classes, functions, components, etc. but not strictly useful when working with small projects.

3. Mention three types of automated tests.

TDD (test driven development)
BDD (behaviour driven development)
ATDD (acceptance test driven development)
